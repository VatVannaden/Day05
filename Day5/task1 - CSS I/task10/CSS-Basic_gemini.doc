CSS Box Model
The CSS box model represents each HTML element as a box made up of four components:

Content: The actual content of the element (text, images, etc.).
Padding: The space between the content and the border.
Border: The outline of the element.
Margin: The space outside the border, separating the element from other elements.
The total width and height of an element are calculated as follows:

width = content width + padding left + padding right + border left + border right + margin left + margin right;
height = content height + padding top + padding bottom + border top + border bottom + margin top + margin bottom; Â  

Example HTML Layout and Styling
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>CSS Box Model Example</title>
    <style>
        .box {
            width: 200px;
            height: 100px;
            border: 1px solid black;
            padding: 10px;
            margin: 20px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="box">This is a box</div>
</body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

This HTML code creates a box element with the following dimensions:

Content width: 200px - 10px (padding left) - 10px (padding right) - 1px (border left) - 1px (border right) = 178px
Content height: 100px - 10px (padding top) - 10px (padding bottom) - 1px (border top) - 1px (border bottom) = 78px
Visual Examples:

Changing Padding:

box with different padding values

Increasing the padding will create more space between the content and the border.

Changing Margin:
Opens in a new window

box with different margin values

Increasing the margin will create more space between the box and other elements.

Changing Border:

You can customize the border style, width, and color using the border-style, border-width, and border-color properties.

By understanding the CSS box model and its components, you can effectively control the layout and spacing of elements on your web pages.
