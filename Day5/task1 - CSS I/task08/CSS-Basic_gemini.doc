Applying Colors and Backgrounds in CSS
CSS offers a variety of ways to apply colors and backgrounds to HTML elements. Here are some common methods and an example demonstrating their usage:

Setting Colors
Hex Code: Represents colors as a combination of six hexadecimal digits (e.g., #FF0000 for red).
RGB: Represents colors as a combination of Red, Green, and Blue values (e.g., rgb(255, 0, 0) for red).
HSL: Represents colors using Hue, Saturation, and Lightness (e.g., hsl(0, 100%, 50%) for red).
Setting Backgrounds
Solid Color: Sets a uniform color for the background using the background-color property.
Gradient: Creates a smooth transition between multiple colors using the background-image property and the linear-gradient or radial-gradient functions.
Image: Sets an image as the background using the background-image property.
Example
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Color and Background Example</title>
    <style>
        .hex-color {
            background-color: #FF00FF;
        }

        .rgb-color {
            background-color: rgb(0, 255, 0);
        }

        .hsl-color {
            background-color: hsl(120, 100%, 50%);
        }

        .gradient-background {
            background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #FF0000, #FFFF00);
        }

        .image-background {
            background-image: url("image.jpg");
            background-size: cover;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="hex-color">Hex Color</div>
    <div class="rgb-color">RGB Color</div>
    <div class="hsl-color">HSL Color</div>
    <div class="gradient-background">Gradient Background</div>
    <div class="image-background">Image Background</div>
</body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

RGB Color: The element with the class rgb-color has a background color of rgb(0, 255, 0), which is a green color.
HSL Color: The element with the class hsl-color has a background color of hsl(120, 100%, 50%), which is a cyan color.
Gradient Background: The element with the class gradient-background has a linear gradient background that transitions from red to yellow.
Image Background: The element with the class image-background has an image named "image.jpg" as its background, and the background-size: cover; property ensures that the image covers the entire element without distortion.
You can experiment with different color values and background properties to create various visual effects and styles for your web pages.
