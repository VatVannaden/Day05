Tables vs. <div> Elements for Layout
Tables were originally designed for presenting tabular data, but they were often misused for layout purposes. While possible, using tables for layout can lead to complex and difficult-to-maintain code.

<div> elements are more flexible and modern for creating layouts. They are designed to be content containers and can be styled using CSS to achieve various layout effects.

When to Use Tables
Presenting tabular data: Tables are ideal for displaying data in rows and columns, such as spreadsheets or schedules.
Creating simple grids: For basic grids with a fixed number of rows and columns, tables can be used.
When to Use <div> Elements
Complex layouts: <div> elements provide greater flexibility for creating complex layouts, including responsive designs.
Semantic structure: <div> elements can be used to define the semantic structure of a page, making it more accessible and understandable for both humans and machines.
Styling and positioning: CSS can be used to style and position <div> elements to create various layouts.
Example HTML Document
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Layout Example</title>
    <style>
        table {
            border-collapse: collapse;
            width: 100%;
        }

        th, td {
            border: 1px solid black;
            padding: 8px;
            text-align: left;
        }

        .container {
            display: flex;
            flex-wrap: wrap;
        }

        .box {
            width: 200px;
            height: 100px;
            margin: 10px;
            border: 1px solid blue;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Table Layout</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Header 1</th>
            <th>Header 2</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cell 1</td>
            <td>Cell 2</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Div Layout</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="box">Box 1</div>
        <div class="box">Box 2</div>
        <div class="box">Box 3</div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

Explanation
Table Layout: The table is used to create a simple grid structure with rows and columns. The border-collapse: collapse; property merges the borders of adjacent cells for a cleaner look.
Div Layout: The <div> elements are used to create a flexible layout using the flexbox model. The container class defines a flex container, and the box class styles each individual box.
In general, it's recommended to use <div> elements for layout unless you need to present data in a tabular format. Using <div> elements provides more flexibility, maintainability, and accessibility.
