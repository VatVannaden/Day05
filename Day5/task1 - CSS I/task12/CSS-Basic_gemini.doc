Flexbox Layout Model
Flexbox is a CSS layout module designed to provide a flexible and efficient way to arrange items within a container. It's particularly well-suited for creating responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

Key Concepts
Flex Container: The parent element that contains flex items.
Flex Item: The child elements within a flex container.
Flex Axis: The main axis along which flex items are arranged.
Cross Axis: The axis perpendicular to the flex axis.
Properties
display: flex;: Sets the container to be a flex container.
flex-direction: Specifies the direction of the flex axis (row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse).
justify-content: Controls the alignment of items along the main axis.
flex-start: Items are aligned to the start of the container.
flex-end: Items are aligned to the end of the container.
center: Items are centered within the container.
space-between: Items are spaced evenly with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.   
space-around: Items are spaced evenly with equal gaps on both sides of each item.
align-items: Controls the alignment of items along the cross axis.
flex-start: Items are aligned to the start of the cross axis.
flex-end: Items are aligned to the end of the cross axis.
center: Items are centered along the cross axis.
stretch: Items are stretched to fill the full height of the container.   
Example: Responsive Layout
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Flexbox Layout</title>
    <style>
        .container {
            display: flex;
            flex-wrap: wrap; /* Allow items to wrap to the next line on smaller screens */
        }

        .box {
            width: 200px;
            height: 100px;
            border: 1px solid black;
            margin: 10px;
        }

        @media (max-width: 768px) {
            .box {
                width: 100%;
            }
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="box">Box 1</div>
        <div class="box">Box 2</div>
        <div class="box">Box 3</div>
        <div class="box">Box   
 4</div>
    </div>   

</body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

Explanation
Flex Container: The using display: flex;.
Flex Items: The .box class styles the child elements within the container.
Responsive Adjustment: The media query ensures that on screens smaller than 768 pixels, the .box elements take up the full width of the container, creating a single-column layout.
Layout Properties:
flex-wrap: wrap; allows the flex items to wrap to the next line if they don't fit on a single line.
justify-content and align-items can be used to further customize the layout, but they are not necessary in this simple example.
Flexbox offers a powerful and flexible way to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. By understanding and using the key concepts and properties, you can effectively design and style your web pages.
