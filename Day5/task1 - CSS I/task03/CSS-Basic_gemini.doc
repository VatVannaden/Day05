CSS Selectors: Targeting Elements
CSS selectors are used to specify which HTML elements should be affected by a particular CSS rule. They act as a way to identify and target specific elements within an HTML document.

Types of CSS Selectors
Element Selectors: Target elements based on their tag name.
Class Selectors: Target elements based on their class attribute.
ID Selectors: Target elements based on their unique ID attribute.
Attribute Selectors: Target elements based on their attributes.
Pseudo-Class Selectors: Target elements based on their state or condition.
Example HTML Document
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>CSS Selectors Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="my-heading">This is a heading</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">This is a paragraph.</p>
    <a href="https://example.com" class="link">Click here</a>
    <div>
        <span class="highlight">Highlighted text</span>

Explanation of How Selectors Target Elements
Element selector (h1): Targets all elements with the tag name <h1>.
Class selector (.paragraph): Targets all elements with the class attribute "paragraph".
ID selector (#my-heading): Targets the element with the ID attribute "my-heading". This ID should be unique within the document.
Attribute selector (a[href="https://example.com"]): Targets all <a> elements with the href attribute equal to "https://example.com".
Pseudo-class selector (div:hover): Targets the <div> element when the mouse hovers over it.
By using these selectors, you can precisely target specific elements in your HTML document and apply the desired styles to them.
