Aligning Elements in CSS
CSS offers various methods to align elements horizontally and vertically within a container.

Horizontal Alignment
text-align property: Aligns the content within an element.
left: Aligns text to the left.
center: Centers the text.
right: Aligns text to the right.
justify: Justifies the text between the left and right margins.
Vertical Alignment
vertical-align property: Aligns elements vertically within their parent container.
baseline: Aligns the baseline of the element with the baseline of the parent.
top: Aligns the top of the element with the top of the parent.
middle: Centers the element vertically within the parent.
bottom: Aligns the bottom of the element with the bottom of the parent.
Display Properties
block: Elements are displayed as blocks, taking up the full width of their parent container and starting on a new line.
inline: Elements are displayed inline, without starting on a new line.
inline-block: Elements are displayed inline, but they can have their own width and height.
flex: Elements are displayed as flex items within a flex container, allowing for flexible layout options.
Example HTML Document
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Alignment Example</title>
    <style>
        .container {
            border: 1px solid black;
            padding: 10px;
        }

        .text-center {
            text-align: center;
        }

        .vertical-middle {
            display: flex;
            align-items: center;
        }

        .inline-block {
            display: inline-block;
            border: 1px solid blue;
            padding: 5px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="text-center">Centered text</p>
        <div class="vertical-middle">
            <span>This text is vertically centered</span>
            <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image">
        </div>
        <div class="inline-block">Inline block element</div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

Explanation
Text Alignment: The paragraph with the text-center class is centered using the text-align property.
Vertical Alignment: The div with the vertical-middle class uses the display: flex; property to create a flex container, and the align-items: center; property aligns the items within the container vertically.
Inline Block: The div with the inline-block class is displayed inline but can have its own width and height, allowing it to be positioned next to other elements without starting on a new line.
By combining these techniques, you can create various layouts and alignments for your web pages to achieve the desired visual effects.
