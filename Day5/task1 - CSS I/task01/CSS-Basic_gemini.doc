I'd be glad to provide a comprehensive response to the prompt, combining the best aspects of previous responses and addressing any potential issues:

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a programming language used to style HTML elements. It controls the appearance of web pages, including fonts, colors, layouts, and more. CSS separates the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), making websites easier to maintain and update.

Role in Web Development:

Presentation: CSS defines how HTML elements are displayed on the screen.
Structure: It helps create visually appealing and organized web pages.
Maintainability: Separating content from presentation improves code readability and manageability.
Responsiveness: CSS can be used to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.
HTML Document and CSS Stylesheet:

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Simple CSS Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html> Â  

Use code with caution.

CSS
/* styles.css */

body {
    background-color: lightblue;
    color: white;
    font-size: 20px;
}
Use code with caution.

Explanation of CSS Code:

body: Selects the entire body of the HTML document.
background-color: lightblue;: Sets the background color of the body to light blue.
color: white;: Sets the text color of the body to white.
font-size: 20px;: Sets the font size of the body text to 20 pixels.
Effect on HTML Elements:

The background of the entire page will be light blue.
All text within the body will be white.
The font size of all text within the body will be 20 pixels.
Additional Notes:

You can create more specific styles by targeting individual elements or classes using CSS selectors.
CSS properties can be combined to achieve various effects.
CSS can be used to create complex layouts and animations.
I hope this explanation is clear and helpful!
