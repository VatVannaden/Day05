Differences Between Inline, Internal, and External CSS
Inline CSS: This method involves applying CSS styles directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute.

Example: <h1 style="color: blue;">Hello World</h1>
Advantages:
Quick and easy for small changes.
No need for additional files or sections.
Disadvantages:
Can lead to repetitive code and makes maintenance difficult.
Styles cannot be reused across multiple elements or pages.
Internal CSS: This method uses a <style> element within the <head> section of an HTML document to define styles that apply to that page.

Example:
html
Copy code
<style>
    body { background-color: lightblue; }
    h1 { color: red; }
</style>
Advantages:
Styles are contained within the document, making it easier to manage.
Allows for more complex styling compared to inline CSS.
Disadvantages:
Styles do not apply to other pages unless they are duplicated.
Can increase the size of the HTML document.
External CSS: This method links to a separate CSS file using a <link> element in the <head> section of an HTML document.

Example:
html
Copy code
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
Advantages:
Promotes a clean separation of content and presentation.
Styles can be reused across multiple HTML documents, making maintenance easier.
Disadvantages:
Requires an additional HTTP request to load the CSS file, which can slow down page loading times.
If the CSS file is not linked correctly, styles may not appear.
HTML Page Demonstrating All Three Methods
Here's an example of an HTML page that demonstrates inline, internal, and external CSS:

HTML Document (index.html)
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>CSS Methods Demonstration</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> <!-- External CSS -->
    <style>
        /* Internal CSS */
        h1 {
            font-size: 28px;
            color: orange;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 style="color: blue;">This is an Inline CSS Example</h1> <!-- Inline CSS -->
    <p>This paragraph demonstrates the use of internal CSS for styling.</p>
    <p>This is a normal paragraph without any special styles.</p>
</body>
</html>
External CSS Stylesheet (styles.css)
css
Copy code
/* External CSS */
body {
    background-color: lightgray;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

p {
    color: darkgreen;
    font-size: 16px;
}
Explanation of Each Method in the HTML Example
Inline CSS:

Used in the <h1> element: style="color: blue;"
The blue color is applied only to this specific header. Itâ€™s straightforward for one-off styling.
Internal CSS:

Defined in the <style> section within the <head> of the HTML document.
It styles all <h1> elements on that page, setting the font size to 28 pixels and the color to orange. This approach is useful for single-page styles.
External CSS:

The CSS rules in styles.css apply to all linked pages.
For example, it sets a light gray background for the entire body and styles paragraphs with dark green text. This promotes reusability and a consistent look across multiple pages.
Summary of Advantages and Disadvantages
Method	Advantages	Disadvantages
Inline CSS	Quick for small changes; easy to implement	Difficult to maintain; leads to repetitive code
Internal CSS	Easier management for single pages; allows complex styles	Styles not reusable; can increase HTML document size
External CSS	Promotes clean separation of content and presentation; reusable styles	Requires additional HTTP request; linking issues can arise
Using a combination of these methods can help achieve the desired layout and styling while maintaining flexibility and ease of maintenance in web development.
