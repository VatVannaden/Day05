Online Fonts
Online fonts are digital font files that are hosted on external servers and can be accessed and used on websites without the need to download and install them locally. This provides a convenient way to use a wide variety of fonts on your website, including premium fonts that might not be available for free download.

Using Google Fonts in an HTML Document
Google Fonts is a popular service that offers a vast library of free fonts that can be easily integrated into your website. Here's how to use Google Fonts in an HTML document:

Choose Fonts: Visit the Google Fonts website (https://fonts.google.com/) and select the fonts you want to use.
Generate Code: Click the "Select" button next to each font, then click the "View Code" button. This will generate a <link> tag that you need to include in your HTML document's <head> section.
Include in HTML: Paste the generated <link> tag into the <head> section of your HTML document.
Example:

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Using Google Fonts</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto|Open+Sans">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

In this example, the code includes the "Roboto" and "Open Sans" fonts from Google Fonts. You can then use these fonts in your CSS styles to style the text on your website.

Favicons
A favicon is a small, square image that is displayed in the browser's tab or address bar, representing your website. It helps users identify your website and can enhance its overall branding.

Adding a Favicon to a Web Page
Create a Favicon: Design or find a square image (typically 16x16 or 32x32 pixels) to use as your favicon.
Save as ICO: Save the image in the .ico format (if possible). If you have a different image format (e.g., .png), you can use online tools to convert it to .ico.
Add to HTML: Place the favicon file in your website's root directory and add the following <link> tag to the <head> section of your HTML document:
<!-- end list -->

HTML
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico">
Use code with caution.

Replace "favicon.ico" with the actual name of your favicon file.

Example:

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="images/favicon.ico">
</head>
<body>
    </body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate online fonts and favicons into your website, enhancing its visual appeal and branding.
