CSS Compilation: A Breakdown
CSS compilation is the process of converting preprocessed CSS code (written in languages like Sass or Less) into standard CSS that can be understood by web browsers. This compilation step often involves the addition of vendor prefixes, variable expansion, and mixin application.

How CSS Compilation Works with Preprocessors
Parsing: The preprocessor parses the source code, analyzing its structure and identifying elements like variables, mixins, and nesting.
Evaluation: The preprocessor evaluates variables, functions, and expressions, replacing them with their corresponding values.
Expansion: Nesting is flattened, and mixins are applied, expanding the code into a more standard CSS structure.
Vendor Prefixing: The preprocessor can automatically add vendor prefixes to CSS properties that are not yet widely supported by browsers.
Output: The compiled CSS is generated, ready to be included in your HTML document.
Steps Involved in Compiling Sass to CSS
Installation: Ensure you have Sass installed on your system.
Writing Sass: Create a Sass file (typically with a .scss extension) containing your preprocessed CSS code.
Compilation: Use the Sass command-line tool or a build system like Webpack or Gulp to compile the Sass file into a CSS file.
Example: Sass to CSS
Sass file (example.scss):

SCSS
$primary-color: #333;

.button {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}
Use code with caution.

Compiled CSS:

CSS
.button {
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}
Use code with caution.

In this example, the Sass variable $primary-color is replaced with its value during compilation, resulting in the final CSS code.

Note: The specific compilation process and output may vary depending on the preprocessor and configuration used.
