CSS Grid System
The CSS Grid Layout module provides a powerful and flexible way to arrange items on a grid. It's particularly useful for creating complex layouts that adapt well to different screen sizes.

Key Concepts:

Grid Container: The parent element that contains the grid items.
Grid Item: The child elements within the grid container.
Grid Track: A line within the grid that defines the spacing and size of the grid items.
Grid Line: A point along a grid track.
Implementation:

Set the container to be a grid container:

CSS
.container {
    display: grid;
}
Use code with caution.

Define the grid structure:

CSS
.container {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
    grid-gap: 20px;
}
Use code with caution.

grid-template-columns defines the number and size of columns. repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr)) creates a flexible grid with a minimum column width of 200px and adjusts the number of columns based on the available space.
grid-gap sets the spacing between grid items.
Place grid items:

CSS
.item {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    padding: 20px;
}
Use code with caution.

Responsive Layout with Breakpoints:

CSS
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
    grid-gap: 20px;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .container {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    }
}
Use code with caution.

In this example, the grid layout adapts to different screen sizes using a media query. On screens smaller than 768px, the grid changes to a single-column layout.

Additional Properties:

grid-template-rows defines the number and size of rows.
grid-template-areas allows for more complex layouts by assigning grid items to specific areas within the grid.
justify-items and align-items control the alignment of grid items within their grid cells.
Using Bootstrap's Grid System:

Bootstrap provides a pre-built grid system based on CSS Grid Layout. You can use Bootstrap's classes to create responsive layouts without writing custom CSS. For example, to create a two-column layout on larger screens and a single-column layout on smaller screens, you can use the following classes:

HTML
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">Column 1</div>
        <div class="col-md-6">Column 2</div>
    </div>
</div>
Use code with caution.

Bootstrap's grid system handles the media queries and responsive adjustments for you, making it easier to create responsive layouts.
