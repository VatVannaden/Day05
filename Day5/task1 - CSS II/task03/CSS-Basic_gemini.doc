Sass: A Supercharged CSS
Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of standard CSS. It introduces features like variables, nesting, mixins, functions, and more, making it easier to write maintainable and reusable stylesheets. Â  

Key Differences Between Sass and Regular CSS
Nesting: Sass allows you to nest selectors, making your code more readable and easier to understand.
Variables: You can define variables to store values that can be reused throughout your stylesheet.
Mixins: Mixins allow you to create reusable blocks of CSS code that can be included in multiple selectors.
Functions: Sass includes built-in functions or allows you to define your own, providing more flexibility and control over your styles.
Partials: Sass uses partial files (files with a .scss extension) to organize your stylesheets into smaller, more manageable components.
Imports: Sass allows you to import partial files into your main stylesheet using the @import rule.
Example: Sass with Nesting, Partials, and Imports
main.scss:

SCSS
@import 'variables';
@import 'mixins';
@import 'base';

.button {
  @include button-style;
  background-color: $primary-color;
}
Use code with caution.

variables.scss:

SCSS
$primary-color: #333;
Use code with caution.

mixins.scss:

SCSS
@mixin button-style {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}
Use code with caution.

base.scss:

SCSS
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
Use code with caution.

Compiled CSS:

CSS
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

.button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  background-color: #333;
}
Use code with caution.

Notable Differences from Standard CSS:

Nesting: The .button selector is nested within the @include button-style mixin, making the code more concise and readable.
Variables: The $primary-color variable is defined in a separate partial file and used in the .button selector.
Mixins: The button-style mixin is defined in a separate partial file and included in the .button selector using the @include directive.
Partials and Imports: The variables, mixins, and base partial files are imported into the main.scss file using the @import rule.
By using these features, Sass allows you to write more organized, maintainable, and efficient CSS code.
