CSS Components and Code Reusability
CSS Components are reusable blocks of code that define the styles for specific elements or groups of elements. They promote code organization, modularity, and maintainability by encapsulating related styles and making them easier to reuse throughout your project.

Benefits of Using CSS Components
Improved code reusability: Components can be reused multiple times in different parts of your project, reducing redundancy.
Enhanced maintainability: Changes to a component's styles can be made in one place, ensuring consistency across your entire project.
Better organization: Components can help you structure your CSS code into logical units, making it easier to understand and manage.
Creating a Card Component with Sass
Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) is a CSS preprocessor that offers features like variables, nesting, and mixins, which can be used to create components effectively.

Here's a simple Sass component for a card:

Code snippet
// card.scss
.card {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 5px;
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: white;
}

.card-image {
  width: 100%;
  height: 200px;
  object-fit: cover;
}

.card-title {
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.card-description {
  font-size: 14px;
  color: #666;
}

.card-button {
  display: block;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
Use code with caution.

Compiled CSS Output:

CSS
.card {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 5px;
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: white;
}

.card-image {
  width: 100%;
  height: 200px;
  object-fit: cover;
}

.card-title {
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.card-description {
  font-size: 14px;
  color: #666;
}

.card-button {
  display: block;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
Use code with caution.

Structuring Components in a Sass Project
You can organize your Sass components into separate files or folders based on their functionality. For example, you might create a components folder and place your card component in a file named card.scss.

To use the card component in your HTML, you would import it into your main stylesheet:

Code snippet
// main.scss
@import "components/card";
Use code with caution.

This way, you can easily reuse the card component in different parts of your project, and any changes made to the component's styles will be reflected throughout your entire application.
