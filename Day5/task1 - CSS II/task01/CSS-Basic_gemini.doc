CSS Processors: A Brief Overview
A CSS processor is a tool that extends the capabilities of standard CSS syntax. These tools often introduce new features, variables, and functions that can make writing CSS more efficient, maintainable, and powerful.

Popular CSS Preprocessors
Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets): Known for its nesting, variables, mixins, and functions, Sass is one of the most widely used preprocessors.
Less (Leaner CSS): Similar to Sass, Less offers features like variables, mixins, and nesting, but with a slightly different syntax.
Stylus: A more expressive preprocessor with a flexible syntax and features like variables, mixins, and inheritance.
Advantages of Using a CSS Processor
Improved Maintainability: CSS processors allow you to define variables, mixins, and functions, making your code more modular and easier to update.
Enhanced Efficiency: By using features like nesting and inheritance, you can reduce the amount of repetitive code, making your stylesheets more concise.
Nesting: CSS processors allow you to nest selectors, making your code more readable and easier to understand.
Variables: You can define variables to store values that can be reused throughout your stylesheet, making it easier to update and maintain.
Mixins: Mixins allow you to create reusable blocks of CSS code that can be included in multiple selectors.
Functions: CSS processors often include built-in functions or allow you to define your own, providing more flexibility and control over your styles.
Code Example: Sass
SCSS
$primary-color: #333;

.button {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.button-hover {
  background-color: darken($primary-color, 10%);
}
Use code with caution.

In this example, Sass is used to:

Define a variable: $primary-color stores the primary color value.
Nest selectors: The .button-hover selector is nested within the .button selector, making the code more readable.
Use a built-in function: darken() is used to darken the $primary-color by 10% for the .button-hover state.
By using these features, Sass helps you write cleaner, more maintainable CSS code.
