What is the Bootstrap Framework?
Bootstrap is an open-source front-end framework developed by Twitter for designing responsive and mobile-first web applications. It provides a collection of CSS and JavaScript components that help developers build modern web interfaces quickly and efficiently. Bootstrap simplifies the process of creating layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring that web applications look good on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

How Bootstrap Helps in Developing Responsive Web Designs
Responsive Grid System: Bootstrap includes a flexible grid system that divides the page into rows and columns, allowing developers to create fluid layouts that adjust according to the viewport size.
Predefined CSS Classes: It offers a wide range of pre-built CSS classes for common design elements (like buttons, forms, and modals) that help maintain consistent styling across a web application.
JavaScript Components: Bootstrap provides interactive components (like modals, carousels, and dropdowns) that enhance user experience without needing extensive custom JavaScript.
Mobile-First Approach: Bootstrap is designed with a mobile-first philosophy, meaning styles are created to work well on smaller devices first, then adapted for larger screens.
Simple Web Layout Using Bootstrap
Hereâ€™s a simple example of a web layout using Bootstrap components, including a navbar, a grid system, and buttons.
